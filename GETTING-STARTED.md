# Getting Started with LinkedIn Brain

Welcome! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

---

## What is LinkedIn Brain?

A complete system for:
1. **Creating LinkedIn content** that doesn't sound AI-generated
2. **Converting your network** into clients through systematic outreach
3. **Building your personal brand** as a thought leader in your industry

---

## Quick Start (15 Minutes)

### Step 1: Fill In Your Context (10 mins)

**What:** Answer 5 sets of questions about yourself

**Why:** So AI can write in YOUR voice, not generic LinkedIn voice

**Files to fill in:**
1. `context/YOUR-VOICE.md` - How you write
2. `context/YOUR-BIO.md` - Your professional story
3. `context/YOUR-VALUES.md` - What you stand for
4. `context/YOUR-EXPERIENCE.md` - Your career highlights
5. `context/YOUR-ICP.md` - Who you serve

**How:** Open each file, read the prompts, fill in the `[FILL IN]` sections

**Tip:** Don't overthink it. Start rough, refine later.

---

### Step 2: Write Your First Post (5 mins)

**What:** Use a template to write a quick LinkedIn post

**File:** `content-creation/templates/post-template.md`

**Process:**
1. Pick the "Handwritten Style" template (simplest)
2. Write 50-100 words about something you learned recently
3. Apply 3-5 rules from `content-creation/frameworks/humanizer-protocol.md`
4. Read it aloud - does it sound like you?
5. Post it!

**Example (adapt to your industry):**
```
Most people skip validation because building feels faster.

Then they spend 6 months building something nobody wants.

Validation isn't slow. Building the wrong thing is.
```

Or if you're in marketing:
```
Everyone wants viral content.

Nobody wants to post consistently for 2 years.

Viral is luck. Consistency is strategy.
```

Or if you're in leadership:
```
Your team doesn't need more motivation.

They need clearer priorities and fewer blockers.

Leadership isn't inspiring speeches. It's removing friction.
```

## Using with AI Assistants

Once your context files are filled in:

Prompt: "Read my linkedin-brain context files and write a LinkedIn post
about [TOPIC] using the [FRAMEWORK] from content-frameworks.md"
```

### For Outreach
```
Prompt: "Read my linkedin-brain context and draft an outreach message for
[CONTACT NAME] at [COMPANY] using the [FRAMEWORK] from message-frameworks.md"
```

### For Discovery Calls
```
Prompt: "Read my linkedin-brain context and help me prep for a discovery
call with [CONTACT] using the discovery-call-guide.md framework"
```

---

## Common Questions

### "Do I need to fill in ALL the context files?"

**Minimum:** `YOUR-VOICE.md` and `YOUR-BIO.md`

**Recommended:** All 5 files for best results

**Why:** The more context AI has, the better it can match your voice and positioning

---

### "How long should my posts be?"

**Start with:** 50-100 words (Handwritten Style)

**Master that, then:** Try 100-200 words (Structured Posts)

**Avoid:** 300+ words (too long for LinkedIn, people scroll past)

---

### "How often should I post?"

**Minimum:** 1x per week

**Recommended:** 2-3x per week

**Optimal days:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday

**Avoid:** Posting just to post. Quality > Frequency.

---

### "Which outreach framework should I use?"

**Warm contacts (former colleagues):** Framework 1 or 4 (Warm Reconnect / Former Colleague)

**Warm-ish (engaged with your content):** Framework 2 (Value-First)

**Cold but high ICP:** Framework 3 (Direct Value Prop)

**Recent similar work:** Framework 5 (Case Study Hook)

See `outreach/frameworks/message-frameworks.md` for details.

---

### "How do I avoid sounding like AI?"

**Key rules:**
1. Read it aloud - would you say this to a friend?
2. Cut "furthermore," "leverage," "enhance," "optimize"
3. Mix sentence lengths (short, long, medium)
4. Use numbers, not adjectives ("98% fail" not "Most fail")
5. Tell personal stories, not abstract principles

See `content-creation/frameworks/humanizer-protocol.md` for all 25 rules.

---

## Success Metrics

- **Consistency:** Posting 2-3x per week for 3 months
- **Engagement:** Comments > Likes (shows resonance)
- **Voice:** Posts sound like you, not generic AI

### Lead Generation
- **Outreach:** 20+ messages per month

---

## Need Help?

**Stuck on setup?** Re-read the specific section in `SETUP.md`

**Post doesn't sound like you?** Apply more rules from `humanizer-protocol.md`

**Not getting responses?** Check `message-frameworks.md` - are you leading with value?

**General questions?** Review the relevant GUIDE.md file

---

## The Meta-Game

**This isn't about perfection.**

It's about:
- Showing up consistently
- Sounding like yourself
- Providing value
- Building relationships

Start messy. Refine as you go.

The best system is the one you actually use.

Good luck! 🚀
