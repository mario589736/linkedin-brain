# Setup Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you personalize the LinkedIn Brain system for your use.

You'll fill in 5 context files that AI can reference when helping you create content and convert leads.

**Time to complete:** 30-60 minutes

## Step 1: Define Your Voice

**File:** `context/YOUR-VOICE.md`

This defines how you write—your tone, style, and personality.

### Questions to Answer

1. **How do you sound?** (Direct? Conversational? Technical? Warm?)
2. **What's your signature style?** (Short posts? Long narratives? Data-heavy? Story-driven?)
3. **What do you NEVER say?** (Corporate jargon? Humble-brags? Question hooks?)
4. **What metaphors/phrases do you use?** (e.g., "Fix the machine," "Kill bad ideas fast")
5. **How formal are you?** (1st person? Conversational? Professional but casual?)

### Template Provided

Open `context/YOUR-VOICE.md` and fill in the template.

**Examples:**
- "I write short, punchy posts (50-100 words). No fluff."
- "I use numbers over adjectives: '98% fail' not 'Most fail'"
- "I never use 'I hope this finds you well' or 'Let's connect!'"

## Step 2: Define Your Bio & Experience

**File:** `context/YOUR-BIO.md`

This is your professional story—what you've done, what you're known for.

### Questions to Answer

1. **What's your current role?** (Fractional CPO? Founder? Consultant?)
2. **What's your background?** (20 years in tech? Former startup founder?)
3. **What are you known for?** (Scaling teams? Validation? Strategy?)
4. **What's your "special forces" story?** (The thing you parachute in to fix)
5. **Key achievements?** (Specific results: "Scaled team 5→20," "Validated 10+ ventures")

### Template Provided

Open `context/YOUR-BIO.md` and fill in the template.

**Examples:**
- "Product leader with 15 years in tech"
- "Scaled teams at TechCo, built platforms at StartupX"
- "Known for fixing broken product delivery in 3 months"

## Step 3: Define Your Values

**File:** `context/YOUR-VALUES.md`

Your core values guide decisions and shape your voice.

### Questions to Answer

1. **What do you stand for?** (Sovereignty? Radical honesty? Speed?)
2. **What drives your decisions?** (Family? Impact? Autonomy?)
3. **What's non-negotiable?** (Ethics? Work-life balance? Ownership?)
4. **What do you reject?** (Burnout culture? Hustle porn? Corporate politics?)

### Template Provided

Open `context/YOUR-VALUES.md` and fill in the template.

**Examples:**
- "Sovereignty: Own my time, decisions, career"
- "Radical honesty: Say the truth, even when uncomfortable"
- "Sustainable performance: High output without burnout"

## Step 4: Define Your Professional Experience

**File:** `context/YOUR-EXPERIENCE.md`

Your career history in a condensed, scannable format.

### Questions to Answer

1. **What's your career arc?** (Dev → PM → CPO? Founder → Consultant?)
2. **Key roles?** (Last 3-5 roles with companies, dates, achievements)
3. **What pattern emerges?** (Short tenures? Mission-based? Fixer?)
4. **Key skills?** (Technical? Product? Leadership?)
5. **Domains of expertise?** (Health-tech? SaaS? Fintech?)

### Template Provided

Open `context/YOUR-EXPERIENCE.md` and fill in the template.

**Examples:**
- "CPO at TechCo (2022-2024): Scaled team, fixed retention"
- "Founder at StartupX (2015-2017): Bootstrapped to profitability"
- "Pattern: Short-tenure fixer. I enter chaos, install infrastructure, hand over working machine"

## Step 5: Define Your Ideal Client Profile (ICP)

**File:** `context/YOUR-ICP.md`

Who do you serve? Who's your perfect client?

### Questions to Answer

1. **Primary ICP:** (Series A founders? Corporate innovation leads? Product leaders?)
2. **Their pain points:** (What keeps them up at night?)
3. **Company stage:** (Seed? Series A? Corporate?)
4. **Team size:** (5-10? 20-50? 100+?)
5. **Budget range:** (What can they afford?)
6. **Buying triggers:** (Just raised funding? Hiring PMs? Product broken?)

### Template Provided

Open `context/YOUR-ICP.md` and fill in the template.

**Examples:**
- "Series A founders who just raised €5-10M and product delivery is broken"
- "Corporate innovation leads with budget but slow internal IT"
- "Buying trigger: Just hired 3 PMs and shipping slowed down"

---

## Step 6: Review & Test

Once you've filled in all 5 files:

1. **Read them aloud** - Do they sound like you?
2. **Test with AI** - Ask your AI assistant to:
   - "Read my linkedin-brain context and summarize my positioning"
   - "Write a LinkedIn post about [topic] in my voice"
   - "Draft an outreach message for a Series A founder"
3. **Refine** - If the output doesn't sound like you, update your context files

---

## Next Steps

Once your context is complete:

1. **Content Creation:** Read `content-creation/GUIDE.md`
2. **Outreach:** Read `outreach/GUIDE.md`
3. **Start Creating:** Use frameworks to write posts and messages

## Need Help?

If you're stuck:

1. **Look at the examples** in each template file
2. **Ask AI for help:** "Help me define my professional voice for LinkedIn"
3. **Start rough, refine later** - Don't overthink it. Fill it in, test it, iterate.

## Privacy Note

**Your context files are personal.** They're in `.gitignore` so they won't be shared if you fork/share this repo.

Only share frameworks, not your filled-in context.
