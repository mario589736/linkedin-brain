# LinkedIn Post Template

Use this template to structure your posts quickly.

---

## Quick Post Template (Handwritten Style)

**Best for:** Quick observations, insights (50-100 words)

```
[Start with context or observation]

[Develop the thought naturally]

[Let it end where it ends - no forced conclusion]

[Optional: Hashtags]
```

**Example 1 (Startups/Product):**
```
Most founders skip validation because it feels slower than building.

Then they spend 6 months building something nobody wants.

Validation isn't slow. Building the wrong thing is.

#Startups #ProductManagement #Validation
```

**Example 2 (Marketing):**
```
Everyone wants to go viral.

Nobody wants to do the boring work of showing up consistently for 2 years.

Viral is luck. Consistency is strategy.

#Marketing #ContentStrategy #SocialMedia
```

**Example 3 (Leadership):**
```
Your team doesn't need another motivation speech.

They need you to remove the blockers you created.

Leadership is less inspiring, more de-risking.

#Leadership #Management #TeamCulture
```

## Structured Post Template

**Best for:** Educational content, frameworks (100-200 words)

```
[HOOK - 1-2 lines that stop the scroll]

[BODY - Personal insight or educational content]
[Use short sentences. One idea per line.]
[Include specific examples, numbers, or stories]

[CONCLUSION - Actionable advice or clear POV]

[HASHTAGS - Max 5]
```

**Example 1 (Product):**
```
I used to think product management was about features.

Then I joined a venture builder. We killed 98% of ideas before building them.

That's when I learned: The best PMs aren't feature factories. They're hypothesis killers.

They validate before they build. They talk to 50 people before writing code. They kill bad ideas in days, not months.

Speed kills bad ideas. Slow kills good ones.

#ProductManagement #VentureBuilding #Validation #Startups
```

**Example 2 (Sales):**
```
I used to think sales was about closing.

Then I tracked my pipeline for 6 months. 80% of lost deals were lost in discovery, not closing.

That's when I learned: The best salespeople aren't closers. They're qualifiers.

They ask hard questions upfront. They walk away from bad fits. They close deals in discovery, not at the end.

Qualify hard, close easy.

## Before/After Template

**Best for:** Sharing lessons learned, mindset shifts

```
I used to think [OLD BELIEF].

Then [TURNING POINT].

Now I know [NEW BELIEF].

[LESSON/TAKEAWAY]

#Hashtags
```

---

## Problem/Solution Template

**Best for:** Tactical advice, how-to content

```
[PROBLEM - Relatable pain point]

Why? [ROOT CAUSE]

The fix: [SOLUTION]

Here's how:
1. [STEP 1]
2. [STEP 2]
3. [STEP 3]

[IMPACT STATEMENT]

#Hashtags
```

---

## List/Framework Template

**Best for:** Breaking down complex topics

```
[NUMBER] things I learned [DOING SOMETHING]:

1. [POINT 1]
[Example or explanation]

2. [POINT 2]
[Example or explanation]

3. [POINT 3]
[Example or explanation]

[SYNTHESIS/LESSON]

#Hashtags
```

---

## Story Template

**Best for:** Personal anecdotes with lessons

```
[SETTING THE SCENE]

[WHAT HAPPENED - The story]

[WHAT I LEARNED]

[HOW YOU CAN APPLY IT]

#Hashtags
```

**Example 1 (Product):**
```
Last year I spent 3 months building a feature nobody wanted.

Didn't talk to users. Didn't validate. Just built what I thought was cool.

Launch day: Crickets.

That feature is still at 0.2% adoption. But it taught me more than any successful launch:

Validation isn't optional. It's the whole game.

Talk to 50 people before you write a line of code.

If they don't say "I need this," you just saved yourself 3 months.

#ProductManagement #StartupLessons #Validation
```

**Example 2 (Marketing):**
```
Last year we spent €50k on a rebrand nobody asked for.

Didn't talk to customers. Didn't test messaging. Just hired an expensive agency.

Launch day: Revenue dropped 15%.

That rebrand is still being undone 12 months later. But it taught me everything:

Brand isn't what you say about yourself. It's what customers say about you.

Talk to 50 customers before you change anything.

If they're not asking for it, you're solving the wrong problem.

#Marketing #Branding #CustomerResearch
```

**Example 3 (Leadership):**
```
Last year I promoted someone based on performance, not leadership ability.

They were my best IC. I assumed they'd be a great manager.

3 months later: Half their team wanted to quit.

That promotion is still my biggest regret. But it taught me the hard truth:

Great ICs don't automatically become great managers.

Management is a different skill. Promote for potential, not just past performance.

If they haven't shown leadership at small scale, they won't magically find it at large scale.
