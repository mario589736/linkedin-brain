# LinkedIn Content Creation Guide

Complete system for creating high-performing LinkedIn posts that build authority and drive engagement.

## Core Principles

### Default Style: Handwritten (50-100 words)
- Write like you're texting, not posting
- No predictable structures or obvious patterns
- Feels spontaneous, not planned
- Break conventions: start with context, not a hook
- Let thoughts flow naturally

### Voice Guidelines
- **Direct & Unapologetic:** No hedging. Commit to the POV.
- **Numbers Over Adjectives:** "98% fail" not "Most fail"
- **Experience-Driven:** Personal stories > abstract principles
- **Professional, Not Formal:** First-person, conversational
- **No LinkedIn Formulas:** Avoid "I used to think X. I was wrong." and listicles

---

## Quick Start Guide

**For a quick post:**
1. Pick your style: Handwritten (default) or Structured (occasional)
2. Check for authentic voice (avoid AI patterns)
3. Review what's working in your industry
4. Post and engage with comments

**For deep-dive posts:**
1. Choose a framework from this guide
2. Select content type (text, image, video)
3. Use viral intro if repositioning (see frameworks/)
4. Track performance and iterate

## Structure Selector

### Handwritten Style (Default - 50-100 words)
**When:** Personal observations, insights, contrarian takes
**Why:** Feels authentic, not curated. Stops the scroll.
**Takes:** 5-15 mins to write

**Pattern:**
```
[Start with context or observation]

[Develop the thought naturally]

[Let it end where it ends - no forced conclusion]

[Optional: Hashtags at the end]
```

### Structured Style (Occasional - 100-200 words)
**When:** Educational deep dives, frameworks, case studies
**Why:** Delivers clear value. Teachable moment.
**Takes:** 30-60 mins to write

**Pattern:**
```
[Hook — 1 sentence that stops the scroll]

[Body — Personal insight or educational content]
[Use short sentences. One idea per line.]

[Conclusion — Actionable advice or clear POV]

[Hashtags — Max 5]
```

## Content Pillars (What to Post About)

Define 3-4 core themes you'll consistently address:

### Example Pillar Structure:

**Pillar A: Industry Reality**
Hard truths about your domain, frameworks, common failures

**Pillar B: Your Unique Approach**
Why your method/philosophy differs, strategy + execution

**Pillar C: Professional Values**
Culture, mindset, principles that guide your work

**Pillar D: Practical Tactics** (Optional)
Specific tools, processes, how-tos

---

## Content Calendar Rhythm

**Anchor Post (Tue/Wed):** High-value educational (100-150 words)
**Flex Posts (Thu/Fri):** Lighter observations (50-100 words)
**Frequency:** 2-3x per week

**Why This Works:**
- Mid-week posts get better engagement
- Consistency matters more than frequency
- Mix of deep and light keeps audience engaged

---

## Writing Process

### Step 1: Capture Raw Idea
Write without editing. Get the thought out.

### Step 2: Structure Check
- Does it have a clear point?
- Is it obvious why this matters?
- Would you send this to a colleague?

### Step 3: Humanize
Remove AI patterns:
- "I hope this message finds you well"
- "In today's fast-paced world"
- "Let's dive in"
- "Here's the thing"
- Unnecessary emojis
- Bullet points with predictable structure

### Step 4: Test Read
Read it aloud. Does it sound like you talking?

---

## Engagement Strategy

- Reply to all comments within first 2 hours (boosts reach)
- Ask questions in replies to keep conversation going
- Tag people sparingly (only if genuinely relevant)
- No engagement-baiting ("Tag someone who needs this!")

**Pro Tip:** The first 60 minutes determine reach. Be active during that window.

---

## Content Frameworks

### Framework 1: The Observation
```
[Thing you noticed]

[Why it matters]

[What you do differently]
```

### Framework 2: The Lesson
```
[What happened]

[What went wrong/right]

[What you learned]
```

### Framework 3: The Contrarian Take
```
[Common belief]

[Why it's wrong]

[What to do instead]
```

### Framework 4: The Behind-the-Scenes
```
[What people see]

[What actually happened]

[The real lesson]
```

### Framework 5: The Question
```
[Provocative question]

[Your answer/observation]

[Invite others to share]
```

---

## Post Length Guidelines

**50-75 words:** Quick observations, hot takes, questions
**100-150 words:** Standard posts with insight and context
**150-200 words:** Deep dives, frameworks, case studies
**200+ words:** Rare. Only for exceptional stories or comprehensive guides.

**Rule of Thumb:** If you can say it in fewer words, do.

---

## Hashtag Strategy

**Use 3-5 relevant hashtags:**
- 1-2 broad industry tags (#ProductManagement, #Startups)
- 1-2 specific topic tags (#VentureBuilding, #ValidationFrameworks)
- 1 niche tag (#0to1Products)

**Place at the end.** Don't interrupt the flow of your post.

---

## Content Types

### Text-Only Posts
- Default format
- Best for quick insights
- Lowest effort, high authenticity

### Text + Image Posts
- Professional photo, chart, or graphic
- Increases engagement 20-30%
- Use for frameworks or data-driven content

### Text + Document Posts
- Carousel format (PDF upload)
- Best for step-by-step guides
- High engagement but more effort

### Video Posts
- You talking to camera
- 30-90 seconds ideal
- Highest engagement but most effort
- Use sparingly for major announcements or stories

### Polls
- Simple A/B questions
- Great for engagement and research
- Use occasionally to break up text posts

## What NOT to Do

❌ **Engagement Bait:** "Like if you agree!"
❌ **Humble Bragging:** "So honored to announce..."
❌ **Corporate Speak:** "Leveraging synergies"
❌ **AI Patterns:** "In today's fast-paced world..."
❌ **Generic Motivation:** "Monday motivation: You got this!"
❌ **Over-Hashtagging:** Using 10+ hashtags
❌ **Link Dumping:** Posts that are just links with no context

---

## Performance Tracking

**Track These Metrics:**
- Impressions (reach)
- Engagement rate (likes + comments / impressions)
- Comments (quality over quantity)
- Profile views (day of post vs. average)
- Connection requests (from target audience)

**What Good Looks Like:**
- 500+ impressions for standard post
- 5%+ engagement rate
- 5+ meaningful comments
- 2-3 profile views/connection requests

**Iterate Based on Data:**
- Which topics get most engagement?
- What post length works best?
- Which style (handwritten vs. structured) performs better?
- What time of day gets best reach?

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Trying Too Hard
Posts that feel "crafted" perform worse than authentic thoughts.

**Fix:** Write like you're explaining to a colleague, not presenting at a conference.

### Mistake 2: No Clear Point
Rambling posts that don't land anywhere.

**Fix:** Ask yourself: "What's the one thing I want them to remember?"

### Mistake 3: Too Much Setup
Taking 100 words to get to the insight.

**Fix:** Start with the insight, add context if needed.

### Mistake 4: Posting for Likes
Creating content for virality instead of value.

**Fix:** Post what's genuinely useful to your target audience.

### Mistake 5: Inconsistency
Posting 5 times one week, then nothing for a month.

**Fix:** 2-3x per week consistently beats sporadic high volume.

## Advanced Tips

### The "Hook + Story + Lesson" Pattern
Works for longer posts (150+ words):
1. Bold statement or surprising fact (hook)
2. Personal story or example (relatability)
3. Actionable lesson (value)

### The "Problem → Insight → Solution" Pattern
Works for educational content:
1. State the common problem
2. Share your unique insight
3. Offer a practical solution

### The "What I Used to Think" Pattern
(Use sparingly—it's becoming a LinkedIn cliché)
1. Common belief you held
2. What changed your mind
3. What you believe now

---

## When to Post

**Best Days:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
**Best Times:** 8-9am, 12-1pm, 5-6pm (your timezone)
**Worst Days:** Saturday, Sunday
**Worst Times:** After 8pm, before 7am

**Pro Tip:** Experiment with your audience. B2B decision-makers may engage differently than your timezone suggests.

## Remember

1. **Consistency > Perfection:** Published is better than perfect.
2. **Authenticity > Virality:** Build trust with your niche, not likes from everyone.
3. **Value > Volume:** 2 great posts > 5 mediocre posts.
4. **Engagement > Broadcasting:** Reply to comments. Build relationships.
5. **Long Game:** Authority builds over months, not days.

Your LinkedIn content should attract the people you want to work with. Every post is either bringing them closer or pushing them away. Choose wisely.
