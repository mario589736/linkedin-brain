# The Humanizer Protocol

25 rules to avoid "AI Voice" and sound like a real human.

Apply these rules to make your writing feel natural and authentic, not generated.

## Sentence Structure & Variety

### 1. Mix Sentence Lengths
Include at least one very short and one long sentence per 100–150 words.

### 2. Combine Sentences
Fuse some short sentences into clause-heavy ones using dashes or semicolons.

### 3. Split Long Sentences
Break some into 2-3 clean, short ones.

### 4. Vary Sentence Starters
Do not begin sentences in the same way (avoid starting 3 lines with "I").

### 5. Change Structure
Rotate simple, compound, and complex sentences.

### 6. Avoid Neat Triplets
Do not end every idea with three balanced items.

### 7. Reorder Structure
Change order of ideas (put Effect before Cause, or vice versa).

---

## Paragraphs & Flow

### 8. Vary Paragraph Length
Keep at least one notably shorter or longer than neighbors.

### 9. Implicit Links
Don't spell out every step (avoid over-explanation).

### 10. Remove Reflective Conclusions
Cut summaries/conclusions at the end of paragraphs if possible.

### 11. Shuffle Linkers
Swap "and/but/because" with "plus, yet, besides, whereas, along with".

### 12. Limit Transition Words
Remove or replace "however, therefore, furthermore".

---

## Word Choice & Clarity

### 13. Cut Redundancy
Delete if two sentences say the same thing.

### 14. Say It Once
Avoid paraphrased restatements later in the paragraph.

### 15. Replace Inflated Verbs
Use "improve" instead of "enhance", "use" instead of "leverage".

### 16. Trim Scaffolding
Cut "in order to", "due to the fact that".

### 17. Avoid Clichés
Swap tired phrases for fresh, concrete wording.

### 18. Vary Prepositions
Use "in, at, by, over, next to" where natural.

### 19. Avoid Over-Consistency
Rotate terms if it doesn't confuse.

---

## Tone & Nuance

### 20. Mix Voice
Use a mixture of passive and active voice (but prioritize Active).

### 21. Mix Tenses
Shift tenses sometimes for storytelling.

### 22. Emotional Notes
Keep consistent attitude but allow local emotional notes.

### 23. Tiny Inconsistencies
Let a tense nudge or shifted phrase stand for naturalness.

### 24. Avoid Repetition
No "Research shows... aligns with theory..." back-to-back.

### 25. Active Voice Preference
Use active voice more often, but not always.

## How to Apply

1. **Write your first draft** naturally
2. **Read it aloud** - does it sound like you're talking?
3. **Apply 5-7 rules** from above (not all 25 at once)
4. **Focus on the biggest offenders:**
   - Repetitive sentence starts
   - Over-explained connections
   - Inflated verbs
   - Neat triplets
5. **Read it aloud again** - better?

## Example Before/After

### Before (AI Voice)
```
Furthermore, it is important to note that when building startups, validation is critical.
Therefore, founders should leverage rapid experimentation in order to enhance their
understanding of customer needs. This approach will enable them to optimize their product-market fit.
```

### After (Humanizer Protocol Applied)
```
Startups die when founders skip validation.

Talk to 50 people before you write a line of code. Most won't care about your idea—that's the signal.
The ones who do? They'll tell you exactly what to build.
```

**Another Example (Marketing):**

**Before (AI Voice):**
```
Furthermore, it is important to note that content marketing requires consistency in order to
enhance engagement and optimize reach. Brands should leverage a strategic approach to facilitate
meaningful connections with their target audience.
```

**After (Humanizer Protocol Applied):**
```
Content marketing is a long game.

Post once and disappear? You're invisible. Post daily for 2 years? You're unavoidable.

Consistency beats quality when you're starting. Ship decent work regularly, not perfect work randomly.
```

**Rules Applied:**
- #3: Split long sentence
- #12: Removed "furthermore, therefore"
- #15: Replaced "leverage, enhance, enable, optimize"
- #16: Cut "in order to"
- #1: Mixed sentence lengths (short + medium)

## Common AI Patterns to Avoid

❌ "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally"
✅ Use "Plus," "And," "Also," or just start the sentence

❌ "Leverage," "Utilize," "Facilitate," "Enhance"
✅ Use "Use," "Help," "Improve," "Make better"

❌ "It is important to note that..."
✅ Just say the thing

❌ "In order to"
✅ "To"

❌ Three perfectly balanced bullet points
✅ 2, 4, or 5 points with varying lengths

## Quick Diagnostic

**Your post sounds like AI if:**
- Every sentence starts the same way
- You use "leverage," "facilitate," "optimize"
- Lots of "furthermore, therefore, moreover"
- Perfect structure (Hook → 3 points → Conclusion)
- No personality, quirks, or rough edges

**Your post sounds human if:**
- Sentence rhythm varies (short, long, medium)
- You use simple, direct words
- Some sentences break rules (fragments, etc.)
- It flows like you're talking to a friend
- Has your personality and voice

## Pro Tip

**The "Read Aloud" Test**

If you wouldn't say it out loud to a colleague over coffee, rewrite it.

AI writes for documents. Humans write for conversations.
