## 1. Basic Post Structure

### Hook (First 1-2 Lines)
**Goal:** Stop the scroll.

**What Works:**
- **Contrarian statement:** "I used to think X. I was wrong."
- **Bold claim:** "98% of ventures fail. Here's why."
- **Personal experience:** "I just wasted 60 hours on a feature nobody wanted."
- **Direct challenge:** "Stop optimizing. Start validating."

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Questions: "Have you ever wondered...?" (weak, passive)
- Generic observations: "The startup world is changing..."
- Humble-brags: "I'm so grateful to announce..."

---

### Body (3-7 Short Paragraphs)
**Goal:** Deliver value. Teach something concrete.

**Content Rules:**
- Short sentences
- White space between paragraphs
- Numbers beat adjectives: "98% fail" not "Most fail"
- Specific beats vague: "I used [Tool Name]" not "I used tools"
- Personal beats generic: "At [Company], I learned..." not "Great leaders understand..."

---

### Conclusion (1-2 Lines)
**Goal:** Leave the reader with something actionable or thought-provoking.

**What Works:**
- **Actionable advice:** "Pick up the phone. Forget your Jira workflows."
- **Clear POV:** "Sustainable performance > burnout disguised as commitment."
- **Reflection prompt:** "What would you do differently?"

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Asking for engagement: "What do you think? Comment below!"
- Generic inspiration: "Keep grinding! You got this!"
- Self-promotion: "DM me if you need help with..."

---

### Hashtags (Max 5, at the End)
- Mix **broad** + **niche** relevant to your industry
- Avoid fluff hashtags: `#Inspiration`, `#Hustle`, `#Mindset` (unless directly relevant)

**Examples:**
- Product/Tech: `#ProductManagement`, `#TechLeadership`, `#SaaS`
- Startups: `#Startups`, `#VentureBuilding`, `#Founders`
- Leadership: `#Leadership`, `#TeamBuilding`, `#Culture`

---

## 2. Before vs. After Framework

**Structure:**
- **Before:** My old belief/approach
- **Turning Point:** What changed my mind
- **After:** My new belief/approach
- **Lesson:** The takeaway

**Example 1 (Product/Tech):**
```
I used to think product management was about optimizing funnels.

Then I started venture building. 98% of ideas failed before we even built them.

Now I know: Validation Speed > Code Quality.

The best product managers aren't optimizers. They're hypothesis killers.
```

**Example 2 (Marketing):**
```
I used to think marketing was about being everywhere.

Then I worked with a company spending €50k/month on 10 channels. Zero ROI.

Now I know: Depth beats breadth.

Focus on one channel. Dominate it. Then expand.
```

**Example 3 (Leadership):**
```
I used to think leadership was about having all the answers.

Then I managed a team through a crisis where I had no idea what to do.

Now I know: Leaders ask better questions, not provide perfect answers.

The best leaders create clarity, not certainty.
```

**When to use:** Sharing a mindset shift or lesson learned

---

## 3. Problem → Solution Framework

**Structure:**
- **Problem:** The pain point (relatable)
- **Why It Happens:** Root cause
- **Solution:** The fix (actionable)
- **How to Apply:** Step-by-step

**Example 1 (Product/Startups):**
```
Most founders waste months building the wrong thing.

Why? They skip validation and go straight to code.

The fix: Talk to 50 people before you build anything.

Here's how:
1. Cold email your target customer
2. Ask "How do you solve [problem] today?"
3. If they don't say "I need this," kill the idea

Takes 1 week, saves 6 months.
```

**Example 2 (Sales):**
```
Most salespeople waste time on unqualified leads.

Why? They pitch before they understand the problem.

The fix: Qualify before you pitch.

Here's how:
1. Ask "What's working in your current setup?"
2. Listen for pain points they mention
3. If they're happy with status quo, move on

Saves hours, increases close rate.
```

**Example 3 (Finance/Operations):**
```
Most teams waste budget on tools they don't use.

Why? They buy before they measure actual need.

The fix: Audit first, buy second.

Here's how:
1. Track what you actually use for 30 days
2. Cancel anything under 20% utilization
3. Reallocate saved budget to what matters

Cut 30% of SaaS spend in most cases.
```

**When to use:** Teaching something tactical or giving advice

---

## 4. Framework/List Pattern

**Structure:**
- **Setup:** "Here are the X things that changed everything:"
- **Point 1:** With example
- **Point 2:** With example
- **Point 3:** With example
- **Lesson:** The synthesis

**Example 1 (Startups/Product):**
```
3 things I learned building 10+ ventures:

1. Speed kills bad ideas
Talk to 50 people in week 1. You'll know if it's worth building.

2. Ugly MVPs work
Typeform + Airtable beats perfect code. Ship fast, learn faster.

3. Kill your darlings
If nobody pays, nobody cares. Don't negotiate with failure.

Most startups die slowly. The good ones die fast.
```

**Example 2 (Consulting):**
```
3 things I learned working with 50+ clients:

1. Process beats talent
Average team with great process beats great team with no process.

2. Clarity is kindness
Vague feedback feels nice. Clear feedback drives results.

3. ROI talks, everything else walks
If you can't measure impact, you can't sell the next project.

Consultants who measure results get rehired.
```

**Example 3 (Design/Creative):**
```
3 things I learned in 15 years of design:

1. Constraints breed creativity
Unlimited budget = paralysis. Tight constraints = innovation.

2. Kill your portfolio pieces
If you're still showing work from 3 years ago, you're not growing.

3. Taste develops slowly, skills develop fast
You'll hate your work for years. That's normal. Keep shipping.

Your taste improves faster than your skills. That's the gap.
```

**When to use:** Breaking down a complex topic into digestible pieces

## 5. The 5 Patterns of Top Performers

These patterns are proven to drive engagement:

### Pattern 1: Relatable Tension + Permission
Say what people feel but don't admit.

**Examples:**
- Product: "I used to think 'hustle' meant 60-hour weeks. Now I know it's a process failure."
- Marketing: "I used to think more content = more growth. Then I saw a company post 5x per day with zero engagement."
- Leadership: "I used to think skip-level 1:1s were a waste of time. Then I missed a team exodus I should have seen coming."

---

### Pattern 2: Clear, Actionable Value
Tips people can use immediately (and for free).

**Examples:**
- Product: "Here are the 3 tools I use to validate ideas in 24 hours: [List]"
- Sales: "The 3-question framework I use to qualify leads in 5 minutes: [List]"
- Design: "The 5-minute exercise I use to kill bad design directions early: [List]"

---

### Pattern 3: Personality
A dash of story, humor, or quirks. Not just a LinkedIn lecture.

**Examples:**
- Product: "I once spent 3 months building a feature nobody wanted. Here's what I learned..."
- Consulting: "I once got fired from a project for being too honest. Best thing that happened to my career."
- Finance: "I accidentally deleted a €2M budget model with no backup. Here's what I learned about redundancy..."

---

### Pattern 4: Bold, Engaging Statements
A statement that makes people want to weigh in.

**Examples:**
- Product: "If you need 60 hours to do a 40-hour job, that's not hustle. That's a process failure."
- Marketing: "Followers don't matter. Revenue per follower does."
- Leadership: "Your team doesn't need more motivation. They need clearer priorities."

---

### Pattern 5: Community Cues
Invite people to engage (without begging for comments).

**Example:** "What would you do differently?" or "Tell me if this resonates."

## Choosing the Right Framework

| Situation | Framework |
|---|---|
| Mindset shift or lesson learned | Before vs. After |
| Teaching something tactical | Problem → Solution |
| Breaking down complex topic | Framework/List |
| Maximum engagement | Mix Patterns 1-5 |
| Just a thought or observation | Handwritten (no structure) |

---

## Pro Tips

### Handwritten > Templated
Write like you're texting, not posting. Let thoughts flow naturally.

### Numbers > Adjectives
"98% fail" beats "Most fail" every time.

### Personal > Generic
"At [Company], I learned..." beats "Great leaders understand..."

### Specific > Vague
Name the tool, framework, or company. Details = credibility.

## Quick Diagnostic

**Your post is working if:**
- Hook stops the scroll (first 2 lines)
- Body delivers clear value (people learn something)
- Conclusion leaves them thinking
- It sounds like YOU, not a corporate PR team

**Your post needs work if:**
- Generic hooks ("Ever wondered...?")
- No concrete examples or numbers
- Reads like AI wrote it
- You wouldn't say this out loud to a friend

---

## Next Steps

1. **Pick a framework** that fits your message
2. **Write your first draft** using the structure
3. **Apply Humanizer Protocol** (see humanizer-protocol.md)
4. **Read it aloud** - does it sound like you?
5. **Refine and post**

Remember: Structure is a tool, not a cage. Use it to get started, then break the rules as needed.
