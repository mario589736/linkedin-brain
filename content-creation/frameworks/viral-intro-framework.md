# The Viral Intro/Re-Intro Framework

A proven 7-step framework for high-reach introduction posts.

---

## When to Use This

- **New profile** or building authority from scratch
- **Career pivot** (e.g., transitioning roles or going independent)
- **Repositioning** (changing what you're known for)
- **Building network** (want to attract new connections)

---

## Why It Works

**The Psychology:**
- **Vulnerability + Achievement = Relatability + Credibility**
- People want to know WHO they're following before they hit the button
- The "before" makes the "after" more impressive
- The struggle phase builds trust (you're human, not a humble-bragger)

---

## The 7-Step Structure

### 1. Impressive Achievement Hook
Start with a number or achievement that stops the scroll.

**Examples:**
- "I've built 10+ ventures in 2 years. 98% failed."
- "I scaled a team from 5 to 20 in 18 months."
- "I resigned from my [SALARY] role to go freelance."

**Why Numbers Work:**
- Specific > vague
- Credibility signal
- Makes people curious about the story

---

### 2. Personal Identifier
Who you are + one memorable detail.

**Examples:**
- "I'm [NAME], a [ROLE] who doesn't just manage—I build."
- "I'm the person you call when your [PROBLEM AREA] is chaos."

**The Memorable Detail Trick:**
- Add a quirk or personal detail that makes you memorable
- Example: "I'm the 'Fixer' [YOUR TITLE]"

---

### 3. Before & After Timeline
Brutally honest about the "before." Specific details.

**Structure:**
- **Before:** [Struggle/Starting point]
- **Turning Point:** [What changed]
- **After:** [Where you are now]

**Example:**
```
5 years ago, I was stuck in [SITUATION].

Then I [PIVOTAL ACTION]. Failed. Lost money. Learned everything.

Now I [CURRENT WORK]. Most fail fast—that's the point.
```

**Critical:** The "before" must be relatable. Not "I was already successful." More like "I was struggling, confused, or stuck."

---

### 4. The Struggle Phase
Failure + emotions. Key for credibility.

**What to Include:**
- Specific failures (not vague "challenges")
- Emotional honesty ("I had a breakdown," "I felt trapped")
- What you learned from it

**Example:**
```
I once spent 3 months building a feature nobody wanted.

It hurt. Not just the time—the realization that I'd skipped validation and fallen in love with my solution.

That's when I learned: Speed kills bad ideas. Slow kills good ones.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Vulnerability = relatability
- Shows growth, not perfection
- Builds trust ("This person is real")

---

### 5. What to Expect (Value Prop)
Tell people what they'll get by following you.

**Structure:**
- **What I share:** [Topics/Themes]
- **Who it's for:** [Target audience]
- **What you'll learn:** [Outcomes]

**Example:**
```
I share:
- Hard truths about [YOUR DOMAIN]
- How to [KEY OUTCOME] in days, not months
- What it takes to be [YOUR ROLE TYPE]

If you're [TARGET AUDIENCE], you'll get value here.
```

---

### 6. Engagement CTA
Invite people to connect. Simple and direct.

**Examples:**
- "Tell me about yourself in the comments."
- "What are you building right now?"
- "Drop a comment if this resonates."

**Don't:**
- "Like and share if you agree!" (engagement bait)
- "DM me for consulting!" (too salesy)

---

### 7. Community Appreciation
End with gratitude (brief).

**Example:**
- "Thanks for being here."
- "Looking forward to connecting."

**Keep it short.** 1 sentence max.

---

## Full Example Template

```
I [BOLD CAREER MOVE/ACHIEVEMENT].

I'm [NAME], the [MEMORABLE DESCRIPTOR] you call when your [PROBLEM AREA] is chaos.

[X] years ago, I was stuck [RELATABLE STRUGGLE]. Then I [PIVOTAL ACTION].
Failed. Lost money. Learned everything.

Now I [CURRENT WORK]. [X]% fail fast—that's the point.

I spent [TIME] at [COMPANY A] doing [ACHIEVEMENT]. Then [TIME] at [COMPANY B] building
[ACHIEVEMENT]. Then I joined [COMPANY C] to [ACHIEVEMENT].

Most failed. That's what I'm good at: [YOUR UNIQUE VALUE].

I share:
- [VALUE PROPOSITION 1]
- [VALUE PROPOSITION 2]
- [VALUE PROPOSITION 3]

If you're [TARGET AUDIENCE], you'll get value here.

Tell me about yourself—what are you building?

Thanks for being here.

## Adaptation Tips

**Shorter Version (100 words):**
- Keep: Hook, Identifier, Struggle, Value Prop, CTA
- Cut: Detailed timeline

**Video Version:**
- First 2 seconds: Hook ("[BOLD STATEMENT]")
- Next 60 seconds: Before/After/Struggle
- Last 20 seconds: Value Prop + CTA

**Text + Image Version:**
- Use a photo of you at a professional event
- Keep text to 100-150 words
- Image adds credibility

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Too humble:** "I'm just someone who likes [YOUR FIELD]."
✅ **Confident:** "I'm the person you call when [PROBLEM] is chaos."

❌ **No struggle:** "I've always been successful."
✅ **Real struggle:** "I spent 3 months building something nobody wanted."

❌ **Vague value prop:** "I share insights about [GENERAL TOPIC]."
✅ **Specific value prop:** "I teach you how to [SPECIFIC OUTCOME] in days, not months."

## Key Success Metrics

A good viral intro should:
- Get **500+ impressions** (10x your normal reach)
- **20+ comments** (not just likes)
- **10+ connection requests** from your target audience
- Drive profile views (check your LinkedIn analytics)

If it doesn't hit these numbers, iterate and try again in 2-3 weeks.
