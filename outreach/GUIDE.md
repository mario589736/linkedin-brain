# LinkedIn Outreach Guide

Complete system for converting your LinkedIn network into clients through systematic outreach, discovery, and conversion.

## Quick Start (3-Step Process)

### Step 1: Segment Your Network
Identify 20 priority contacts (Hot + High ICP)

### Step 2: Draft & Send Messages
Create value-first DMs, execute 3-touch follow-up sequences

### Step 3: Convert to Clients
Run discovery calls, adapt offer, send proposals, track in pipeline

---

## Core Workflow: Network → Client

### Phase 1: Network Discovery & Segmentation

**Goal:** Identify 50 high-potential contacts, prioritize first 20

**Process:**
1. Export LinkedIn connections (manually or via Sales Navigator)
2. Score each contact:
   - ICP fit (High/Medium/Low): Based on your target client profile
   - Relationship strength (Hot/Warm/Cold): Last contact date
   - Value angle: What problem can you solve for them?
3. Create priority tiers:
   - Tier 1 (20): Hot + High ICP
   - Tier 2 (15): Warm + High ICP
   - Tier 3 (15): Cold + High ICP or Hot/Warm + Medium ICP
4. Create contact files for tracking
5. Update pipeline with "Not Contacted" stage

---

### Phase 2: Outreach Campaign

**Goal:** Start conversations with Tier 1 (20 contacts)

**Pre-Outreach (2-3 days before DM):**
- Engage with their content (like, comment)
- Check recent company news, posts
- Visit their profile

**Outreach Message:**
- Draft value-first DM
- Choose framework based on relationship:
  - **Warm Reconnect:** Former colleagues, recent contacts
  - **Value-First:** Shared insight relevant to their work
  - **Direct Value Prop:** Clear buying signals (recent funding, hiring)
  - **Case Study Hook:** Relevant example from your work
- Reference specific context (their post, company milestone, shared experience)
- Send manually via LinkedIn

**Follow-up Sequence (if no response):**
- **Touch 1:** Day 0 (initial message)
- **Touch 2:** Day 14 (share case study or framework - NO reminder)
- **Touch 3:** Day 30 (direct question about specific challenge)

**Log Everything:**
- Update contact file with message, date, response
- Move to "Contacted" stage in pipeline
- Schedule follow-up reminders

**Target Metrics:**
- 20 messages sent
- 25-30% response rate (5-6 replies expected)

**Reference:** See `frameworks/message-frameworks.md` for templates

---

### Phase 3: Discovery & Conversion

**Goal:** Convert engaged contacts to proposals and clients

**When Someone Responds:**
1. Continue conversation, offer specific value
2. Suggest discovery call: "Would a 25-min call be useful?"
3. Prep for call using research checklist
4. Run discovery call (4 phases):
   - Context (5 mins): What they're building, team size, funding stage
   - Diagnosis (10 mins): Where stuck, what tried, timeline expectations
   - Fit Assessment (5 mins): Can you solve this? Right service format?
   - Soft Close (5 mins): Recommend solution, pricing ballpark, next steps
5. Draft proposal using template
6. Send proposal within 24 hours
7. Follow up after 3-5 days

**Pipeline Movement:**
- Contacted → Engaged (when they respond)
- Engaged → Discovery (when call scheduled)
- Discovery → Proposal (when proposal sent)
- Proposal → Negotiation (when discussing terms)
- Negotiation → Closed Won/Lost

**Target Metrics:**
- 5-6 discovery calls from 20 messages
- 2-3 proposals sent
- 1 client closed (stretch goal for first month)

**Reference:** See `frameworks/discovery-call-guide.md`

---

### Phase 4: Scale & Long-term Nurture

**Goal:** Expand to Tier 2/3, manage long-term pipeline

**Tier 2 Outreach:**
- Repeat Phase 2 with Warm + High ICP contacts (15 more)
- Adjust messaging based on learnings from Tier 1

**Long-term Nurture:**
- For non-responders: Add to quarterly nurture queue
- Set 3-month reminder for value update
- Track as "Long-term Nurture" in pipeline
- Some contacts convert after 1-2 years

**Continuous Actions:**
- Post LinkedIn content 2-3x/week (supports outreach credibility)
- Engage with target audience's content daily
- Refine messaging based on what works
- Update offer/pricing based on discovery feedback

**Target by Quarter End:**
- 50+ contacts messaged
- 10-12 discovery calls completed
- 4-5 proposals sent
- 1-2 clients closed
- Healthy next-quarter pipeline (5-10 active contacts)

## Pipeline Tracking

Track using a simple spreadsheet or CRM:

**Sales Funnel:**
- Not Contacted: [number]
- Contacted: [number]
- Engaged: [number]
- Discovery: [number]
- Proposal: [number]
- Negotiation: [number]
- Closed Won: [number]
- Closed Lost: [number]

**This Week's Actions:**
- Priority outreach: [5 contacts]
- Follow-ups needed: [3 contacts]
- Discovery calls: [Schedule with X, Y]
- Proposals to send: [Company Z]

---

## Key Success Factors

1. **Direct Outreach > Posting:** Prioritize messaging over content (but do both)
2. **Don't Fear Follow-ups:** 60-70% conversions happen in touches 2-3
3. **Cases Sell:** Lead with similar examples, adapt to their need
4. **Start Lower Pricing:** Removes barrier, collect testimonials first
5. **Long Sales Cycles:** First client may take 3-4 months
6. **Quarterly Nurture:** Some convert after years—stay in touch
7. **Batch Similar Contacts:** Message groups with similar value prop

---

## Contact File Structure

Each contact should have a record tracking:

- **Profile:** Name, Company, Role, LinkedIn URL, Company Stage
- **ICP Fit:** Score + Reasoning
- **Relationship Strength:** Hot/Warm/Cold + Last interaction
- **Pipeline Stage:** Current stage in sales funnel
- **Pain Points:** Challenges mentioned
- **Service Format:** Which offer fits best
- **Outreach Log:** All messages sent (dates, content, responses)
- **Discovery Notes:** Key insights from calls
- **Next Action:** What to do next + when

---

## Message Best Practices

### What TO Do:
- Personalize every message (reference recent activity, company news)
- Lead with value, not ask
- Keep it short (3-5 sentences)
- Sound like a human texting, not a LinkedIn post
- Make it easy to respond (simple questions)

### What NOT to Do:
- "I hope this message finds you well"
- "I'd love to connect and explore synergies"
- "I came across your profile and was impressed"
- "Just circling back on my last message"
- Generic templates with no personalization
- Ask for 15-minute calls (say "quick call" or "coffee")

---

## Discovery Call Best Practices

### Pre-Call:
- Research their LinkedIn, company website, recent news
- Form hypothesis about their likely problem
- Prepare 3-4 specific questions based on their situation

### During Call:
- Let them talk 70% of the time
- Ask "What happens if this doesn't get solved in 3-6 months?"
- Watch for budget signals (flinch vs. no-flinch on pricing)
- Recommend specific service format, not "let me know what you need"

### Post-Call:
- Capture notes immediately (pain points, budget signals, red flags)
- Send proposal within 24 hours
- Include specific things they mentioned
- Follow up in 3-5 days if no response

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Generic Outreach
Sending the same message to everyone.

**Fix:** Reference something specific about each person (post, company news, shared experience)

### Mistake 2: No Follow-Up
Giving up after one message.

**Fix:** 60-70% of responses come from touches 2-3. Follow up with value, not "just checking in"

### Mistake 3: Too Much Talking on Calls
Pitching instead of diagnosing.

**Fix:** Ask questions, let them talk 70% of the time, diagnose before recommending

### Mistake 4: Vague Proposals
"I can help with whatever you need"

**Fix:** Recommend ONE specific service format with clear scope, timeline, pricing

### Mistake 5: Taking Bad-Fit Clients
Working with anyone who says yes.

**Fix:** Qualify hard. Bad clients are worse than no clients. Walk away from red flags.

## Getting Started

1. **Segment Network:** Export your LinkedIn connections and score by ICP fit + relationship strength
2. **Draft First Message:** Pick 5 Tier 1 contacts and draft personalized outreach
3. **Set Up Tracking:** Create simple spreadsheet or doc for pipeline tracking
4. **Send Messages:** Start with 5-10 messages, test and refine
5. **Scale Up:** Once you have a 25%+ response rate, scale to 20+ contacts

Remember: This is a numbers game, but personalization matters. Quality > quantity, but you need enough volume to convert. First client might take 3-4 months. Stay consistent, track everything, and iterate based on what works.
