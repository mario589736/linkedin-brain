25-minute framework to uncover needs and position your services.

---

## Pre-Call Prep (15 minutes)

### Research Checklist

**□ LinkedIn Profile**
- Their background, recent posts
- How long at current company
- Previous roles (any shared context?)

**□ Company Research**
- LinkedIn company page (recent news, team size)
- Website (product, stage, positioning)
- Funding status (Crunchbase if Series A+)

**□ Your Contact File**
- How do you know them?
- Last conversation summary
- What value angle did you lead with?

### Form Hypothesis

**Predict:**
- What's their likely pain point? (based on company stage)
- Which service format would fit?
- What's realistic budget range? (based on funding/size)

**Example:**
- Contact: [NAME], [ROLE] at [INDUSTRY] [STAGE]
- Hypothesis: Post-funding, likely scaling delivery chaos
- Likely fit: [YOUR SERVICE FORMAT]
- Budget: [ESTIMATED RANGE] based on stage

## Call Structure (25 minutes)

### Phase 1: Context (5 mins)

**Goal:** Understand the landscape before diagnosing

**Opening:**
"Thanks for taking the time. Let's dive in—walk me through what you're building right now."

**Key Questions:**
1. "What's the company building?"
2. "How big is the team?" (signals scale/complexity)
3. "Where are you in funding/growth cycle?" (signals budget/urgency)

**Listen for:**
- **Company stage:** Seed, Series A, corporate
- **Team maturity:** Chaos vs. structured
- **Runway pressure:** Burn rate anxiety signals urgency
- **Decision authority:** Are they the buyer?

**Red flags:**
- "We're not sure what we're building yet"
- "Team size changes every week"
- "Need to check with [5 other people]" (not decision maker)

---

### Phase 2: Diagnosis (10 mins)

**Goal:** Uncover the REAL problem

**The Opening Question:**
"Where are you stuck right now?"

Then dig deeper based on their answer:

#### If they say: "Product delivery is slow"

**Ask:**
- "How long does it take to ship a feature now vs. 6 months ago?"
- "What's blocking you? Process, people, technical debt, unclear strategy?"
- "What have you tried already?" (reveals sophistication)

**Listen for:**
- Quantified slowdown ("used to ship weekly, now monthly")
- Root cause awareness (do they know WHY it's slow?)
- Previous attempts (reveals what they value)

**Likely service fit:** [YOUR RELEVANT SERVICE]

---

#### If they say: "We need strategy"

**Ask:**
- "What decision are you trying to make?"
- "What happens if you don't make this decision in next 30/60/90 days?"
- "Who else needs to be involved?" (signals decision complexity)

**Listen for:**
- Specific decision (good) vs. vague "direction" (bad)
- Timeline urgency (investor pressure, competitor threat)
- Stakeholder complexity (solo decision vs. 5-person committee)

**Likely service fit:** [YOUR RELEVANT SERVICE]

---

#### If they say: "Team is struggling"

**Ask:**
- "Struggling how? Quality, speed, morale, process?"
- "When did this start?" (recent event or chronic issue?)
- "What changes happened right before?" (hiring spree, new product, etc.)

**Listen for:**
- Specific struggle (quality = hiring problem, speed = process)
- Catalyst event (doubled team after funding = scaling chaos)
- Current state vs. desired state

**Likely service fit:** [YOUR RELEVANT SERVICE]

---

#### If they say: "We need validation"

**Ask:**
- "What assumptions are you most worried about?"
- "Who are you trying to sell to?" (do they know ICP?)
- "What's the cost of being wrong about this?" (urgency)

**Listen for:**
- Specific risky assumptions (good) vs. vague "market validation" (bad)
- ICP clarity (specific = ready, vague = not ready)
- Downside fear (investor demo, board deadline, competitor launch)

**Likely service fit:** [YOUR RELEVANT SERVICE]

---

### The Critical Question (ALWAYS ASK)

"What happens if this doesn't get solved in the next 3-6 months?"

**This reveals:**
- **Urgency:** Investor pressure, runway, growth targets
- **Budget willingness:** High pain = willing to pay
- **Decision timeline:** Ready to buy now or just exploring?

**Example answers:**
- "Investors will freak out" → HIGH URGENCY
- "We'll keep muddling through" → LOW URGENCY
- "We might miss our growth targets" → MEDIUM URGENCY
- "Not sure, things will be harder" → LOW URGENCY

---

### Phase 3: Fit Assessment (5 mins)

**Goal:** Decide if this is a good match

**Assess silently:**

**□ ICP Match?**
- Does this match your target client profile?
- If no, this is likely not a good fit

**□ Can I solve this?**
- Do I have specific experience with this problem?
- Is this in my zone of genius or forcing it?

**□ Want to work with them?**
- Any red flags? (micromanager, blame culture, unrealistic)
- Energy match? (do they drain or energize me?)

**Ask them:**

**Timeline Question:**
"What's your timeline for getting this fixed?"

**Decode:**
- "Yesterday" = Urgent (but may have unrealistic expectations)
- "Next quarter" = Normal timeline
- "Sometime this year" = Not urgent, may not buy

**Budget Question:**
"What's your budget range for this kind of help?"

**Decode:**
- **If they dodge:** "Not sure yet" → May not have budget
- **If they ask YOU:** "What do you typically charge?" → They have budget
- **If they give range:** "[AMOUNT]?" → They've shopped around, realistic

---

### Phase 4: Soft Close (5 mins)

**Goal:** Recommend solution and set next steps

**The Recommendation:**
"Based on what you've told me, here's what I'd recommend..."

**Match Problem to Service:**

**Problem: Delivery broken**
→ "I'd recommend [SERVICE]—I'd [APPROACH], [TIMEFRAME], [DELIVERABLE]."

**Problem: Need validation**
→ "[SERVICE]—[TIMEFRAME] intensive, we'll [APPROACH], you'll know in [TIME] if this has legs."

**Problem: Build specific thing**
→ "[SERVICE]—[TIMEFRAME], fixed scope, I'll [APPROACH], then hand it off."

**Problem: Need strategic guidance**
→ "[SERVICE]—[FREQUENCY] strategic calls plus async support, you stay hands-on but have experienced brain to consult."

**Problem: Fix specific process**
→ "[SERVICE]—[TIMEFRAME] sprint, install the system, train the team, document everything, you own it after."

---

**Pricing Ballpark:**

Be direct. Don't make them ask.

"For something like this, we're typically talking about [range]."

**Examples:**
- [SERVICE A]: "[PRICE RANGE]"
- [SERVICE B]: "[PRICE RANGE]"
- [SERVICE C]: "[PRICE RANGE]"
- [SERVICE D]: "[PRICE RANGE]"

**Watch their reaction:**
- No flinch = in budget
- Slight flinch but interested = stretch but doable
- Big flinch = out of budget

**If they flinch, ask:**
"Is that in the ballpark of what you were thinking?"

This makes them reveal budget or pushback.

---

**Next Steps:**

**If interested:**
"I'll send over a 1-page proposal by [day]—nothing crazy, just scope and pricing. Then we can hop on a quick call to finalize."

**If needs to think:**
"No problem. What would be helpful to include in a proposal for you?"

(This reveals their hesitation—is it price, scope, timing, or something else?)

**If not ready:**
"Sounds like timing isn't right yet. Happy to check in again in [3 months] when things settle."

(Exit gracefully, add to quarterly nurture queue)

## Common Objections & Responses

### "That's more than we were thinking"

**Response:**
"What range were you thinking?"

(Make them reveal budget)

Then:
- If close: "We could do [slightly reduced scope] for [their number]"
- If far apart: "At that budget, you're looking at [smaller service]. Would that still be useful?"

---

### "We need to see results before committing"

**Response:**
"I get that. What would a meaningful result look like in the first month?"

Then:
- If reasonable: "I can structure it with monthly milestones—if we don't hit month 1, we part ways"
- If unreasonable: "That's not how I work, but here's what I CAN do..."

---

### "Can you send a proposal first?"

**Response:**
"Absolutely. To make sure I'm recommending the right thing, let me ask a few questions..."

(Then run through diagnosis)

Never send proposal without discovery call—you won't have enough info.

---

### "I need to talk to [co-founder/board/team]"

**Response:**
"Makes sense. What concerns do you think they'll have?"

(Uncover real objections now, not later)

Then:
"Would it help if I joined that conversation?"

---

### "We're talking to a few other people"

**Response:**
"Smart. What are you comparing?"

(Understand competition)

Then focus on differentiation:
"Here's what's different about how I work..."

---

## Red Flags to Walk Away

### Budget Red Flags:
- "We don't have budget, can you work for equity?"
- "Can you do trial/free first to prove value?"
- "We'll pay after we see results"

**Your response:**
"I'm focusing on paid projects right now. Happy to revisit when budget is confirmed."

### Scope Red Flags:
- "Can you do everything?" (no clear problem)
- "Need this done by next week" (unrealistic)
- "Just a few hours but..." (expectations are full-time)

**Your response:**
"This sounds bigger than [service format] can handle. You might need [different/bigger engagement]."

### Culture Red Flags:
- "Our last 3 consultants failed" (they're the problem)
- "I'll need daily updates" (micromanager)
- "We'll figure out scope as we go" (no clarity)

**Your response:**
"I don't think I'm the right fit. Here's why..."

Be honest. Bad clients are worse than no clients.
