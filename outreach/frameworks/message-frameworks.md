# Message Frameworks

5 proven templates for LinkedIn outreach + follow-up sequences.

---

## Framework 1: Warm Reconnect → Discovery

**When to use:** Former colleagues, people you've worked with, contacts in last 6 months

**Structure:**
```
[Personal callback to shared experience]

[What you're doing now - one sentence]

[Soft invitation]
```

**Example 1: Former Direct Colleague**
```
Hey [NAME]! Congrats on the [COMPANY] raise—[AMOUNT] is huge.

Remember our [SHARED EXPERIENCE]? Now helping [TARGET AUDIENCE] fix the same [PROBLEM] we lived through.

Would love to catch up and hear what you're building.
```

**Example 2: Recent Contact**
```
Good to see you at [EVENT] last month!

Been thinking about our conversation on [TOPIC]—I'm doing that full-time now for [TARGET CLIENTS].

Coffee next week?
```

**Why it works:**
- Leads with genuine recognition (congrats, good to see you)
- References shared context (credibility)
- Positions services naturally (not salesy)
- Soft close (catch up, not sales call)

---

## Framework 2: Value-First → Soft CTA

**When to use:** Warm-ish contacts, people who engaged with your content, contacts with specific visible challenge

**Structure:**
```
[Specific insight relevant to their situation]

[One concrete example or data point]

[Offer to share more, if useful]
```

**Example 1: Responding to Their Post**
```
Saw your post about [THEIR CHALLENGE].

Classic [STAGE/SITUATION] trap—we had this at [COMPANY]. [SPECIFIC OUTCOME].

Happy to share the framework that fixed it, if you want to dig deeper.
```

**Example 2: Company News Hook**
```
Noticed [COMPANY] is [COMPANY NEWS/MILESTONE].

That's the exact inflection point where most companies' processes break (seen it [X] times now).

If you want the playbook for what works (and what definitely doesn't), happy to share.
```

**Example 3: Industry Challenge**
```
[INDUSTRY] [CHALLENGE] is brutal—[SPECIFIC COMPLICATIONS].

Just wrapped a [PROJECT TYPE] with a similar company ([BRIEF RESULT]).

If you're wrestling with what to build vs. what to kill, I'd love to compare notes.
```

**Why it works:**
- Shows you did research (their post, company news)
- Shares real experience, not theory
- "If you want" removes pressure
- They opt in (self-qualifying)

---

## Framework 3: Direct Value Prop

**When to use:** Cold-ish contacts at perfect ICP companies, recent funding, clear buying signals

**Structure:**
```
[What you do - one clear sentence]

[Buying signal you noticed about them]

[Direct but casual question]
```

**Example 1: Recent Funding**
```
Working with [TARGET AUDIENCE] to fix [PROBLEM]—usually [TIMEFRAME] to get [DESIRED OUTCOME] back on track.

Noticed [COMPANY] just raised [AMOUNT]. Curious if you're hitting the classic post-funding scaling pains yet?

Happy to share what we've seen work (and what definitely doesn't).
```

**Example 2: Hiring Signal**
```
I help [TARGET AUDIENCE] install [YOUR SOLUTION/PROCESS] that actually work ([METHODS/TOOLS]).

Saw you're hiring [X NUMBER] [ROLES] this quarter—that's usually when everything breaks.

Quick call to compare notes? I'd love to hear what's working at [COMPANY].
```

**Example 3: Problem Post**
```
Specialize in [YOUR EXPERTISE]—[YOUR METHODS]. Usually know in [TIMEFRAME] if [KEY QUESTION].

Your post about "[THEIR QUOTE]" hit home—been there.

If you want the decision framework we use, happy to share.
```

**Why it works:**
- Clear positioning in first line
- Shows you did research
- Question creates opening
- Offers value, not sales

---

## Framework 4: Former Colleague Angle

**When to use:** Anyone you worked with directly, strong relationship, high trust

**Structure:**
```
[Remember when we... specific shared experience]

[That's what I'm doing now]

[Let's talk]
```

**Example 1: Shared Project**
```
Remember when we [SPECIFIC PROJECT/CHALLENGE] at [COMPANY] in like [TIMEFRAME]? That was chaos.

Now doing that same thing for [TARGET AUDIENCE]—turns out everyone hits those scaling pains.

Coffee next week? Would love to hear what you're up to at [THEIR COMPANY].
```

**Example 2: Shared Challenge**
```
Remember [SPECIFIC CHALLENGE] at [COMPANY]? Took us [TIMEFRAME] to figure out it was [ROOT CAUSE], not [ASSUMED CAUSE].

That's basically my whole job now—helping [TARGET AUDIENCE] find the real problem, not the obvious one.

Curious what you're wrestling with at [COMPANY]. Quick call?
```

**Example 3: Shared Win**
```
Still think about our [PROJECT] validation sprint—validated in [TIMEFRAME] what could've been [LONGER TIMEFRAME] of building the wrong thing.

Doing that full-time now for [TARGET AUDIENCE]. It's wild how many [AUDIENCE TYPE] skip validation.

Would love to catch up—what are you building at [COMPANY]?
```

**Why it works:**
- Immediate credibility (worked together)
- Specific shared memory (rapport)
- Natural transition to current work
- Focus on them, not just you

---

## Framework 5: Case Study Hook

**When to use:** When you have relevant, recent case similar to their situation

**Structure:**
```
[Just did X for similar company]

[Specific result]

[Made me think of you/your company]
```

**Example 1: Similar Industry**
```
Just wrapped a [PROJECT TYPE] with a [INDUSTRY] [STAGE]—[BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WORK], [SPECIFIC RESULT].

Saw you're at [COMPANY] tackling similar problems.

If you want the debrief on what worked (and what almost derailed us), happy to share.
```

**Example 2: Similar Stage**
```
Spent the last [TIMEFRAME] fixing [PROBLEM] at a [STAGE] [INDUSTRY]—[SITUATION DESCRIPTION].

Got them back to [DESIRED STATE]. Process is documented and repeatable now.

[COMPANY] just raised [STAGE], right? If you're seeing the same patterns, I'd love to compare notes.
```

**Example 3: Similar Problem**
```
Just helped a [ROLE] [ACHIEVE OUTCOME] through [YOUR METHOD]—saved them [TIMEFRAME/COST] of building the wrong thing.

Your post about "[THEIR QUOTE]" made me think of this.

Want the [SOLUTION TYPE] playbook? It's brutal but it works.
```

**Why it works:**
- Social proof (just did this)
- Concrete results (timeframes, percentages)
- Relevance (similar to them)
- Offer, not ask

---

## Follow-up Sequences

### Touch 1: Initial Value Message (Day 0)
Use one of the 5 frameworks above.

---

### Touch 2: Add More Value (Day 14 - If No Response)

**Goal:** Share something valuable, NO reminder

**Structure:**
```
[Share case study/article/framework]

[One-line connection to them]

[No ask, just leave it]
```

**Example 1: Case Study Share**
```
Wrote this case study on how we fixed [PROBLEM] at a [STAGE] company—[BRIEF SITUATION DESCRIPTION].

Thought you might find it relevant: [link]
```

**Example 2: Framework Share**
```
Here's the [TOOL/FRAMEWORK] I mentioned—we use it to [ACHIEVE OUTCOME] in [SHORT TIMEFRAME] instead of [LONG TIMEFRAME]: [link]

Always curious what others use for this.
```

**Example 3: Relevant Post Share**
```
Just posted about [TOPIC]—the [X] things that always break: [link]

Made me think of our conversation. Curious if you're seeing #[NUMBER] ([SPECIFIC CHALLENGE]).
```

**Why it works:**
- No guilt trip ("following up...")
- Pure value add
- Shows continued interest
- Low pressure (no ask)

---

### Touch 3: Direct Question (Day 30 - If Still No Response)

**Goal:** Ask about specific challenge, make it easy to respond

**Structure:**
```
[Direct observation about their company/role]

[Specific question]
```

**Example 1: Hiring Signal**
```
Saw [COMPANY] is hiring [X NUMBER] [ROLES] this quarter.

Curious—are you building new teams or filling gaps from rapid growth?
```

**Example 2: Product Launch**
```
Noticed you shipped [PRODUCT] last week. Big milestone.

What was the hardest part—strategy, execution, or team coordination?
```

**Example 3: Company Stage**
```
[X TIMEFRAME] post-[FUNDING STAGE] now, right?

Are you seeing the classic "team doubled, shipping slowed" pattern, or did you avoid it?
```

**Why it works:**
- Shows continued research
- Specific, not generic
- Genuine question (not pitch)
- Easy to answer (one line)

---

## Voice Note Variations

15-20% higher response rate than text. Use for warmer relationships.

### Voice Note Structure (30-60 seconds)

**Example 1: Former Colleague**
```
"Hey [NAME]! Saw the [COMPANY] funding news—congrats!

Been thinking about our [SHARED EXPERIENCE] days at [COMPANY] a lot lately because I'm basically doing that same thing now for [TARGET AUDIENCE]. [COMMON CHALLENGE] is always such chaos.

Would love to catch up and hear what you're building. Coffee sometime?"
```

**Example 2: Recent Contact**
```
"Hi [NAME]! Hope you're well.

Your post about [TOPIC] really resonated—we lived that exact problem at [COMPANY]. [SPECIFIC OUTCOME].

If you want to dig into what fixed it for us, happy to do a quick call. No pressure, just thought it might be useful."
```

**Why it works:**
- Personal touch (your voice)
- Authentic (harder to fake)
- Warm (hearing tone matters)
- Memorable (stands out from text)

---

## WhatsApp-Style Messaging

For contacts you have on WhatsApp/direct messaging:

**Structure: Multiple short messages instead of one long block**

**Bad (Long block):**
```
Hey! Hope you're well. I saw you're at [COMPANY] now and just raised [STAGE]—congrats! I'm doing [YOUR WORK] helping [TARGET AUDIENCE] fix [PROBLEM]. Would love to catch up. Coffee next week?
```

**Good (Split messages):**
```
Hey! Saw you're at [COMPANY] now

Congrats on the raise btw—[AMOUNT] is huge

Doing [YOUR WORK] these days

Basically helping [TARGET AUDIENCE] fix the same [PROBLEM] we had at [PREVIOUS COMPANY]

Coffee next week? Would love to catch up
```

**Why it works:**
- Easier to read (phone format)
- Feels conversational
- Less intimidating than wall of text
- Natural pauses

---

## Batch Messaging Templates

When messaging similar contacts with same value prop:

### Batch 1: Former Colleagues at Scale-ups
```
Hey [NAME]!

Saw you're at [COMPANY] now—[specific observation about their company].

Remember [shared experience at old company]? Now helping [TARGET AUDIENCE] do that same thing.

Coffee? Would love to hear what you're building.
```

### Batch 2: Founders Who Recently Raised
```
Congrats on the [COMPANY] raise! [STAGE] scaling is wild.

Working with [ROLE TYPE] to fix the classic post-funding chaos (team grows, shipping slows).

If you're hitting those pains yet, happy to share what we've seen work.
```

### Batch 3: [Role] in [Vertical]
```
[INDUSTRY] [CHALLENGE TYPE] challenges are unique—especially [specific challenge].

Been working in [industry] for [time] and keep seeing the same patterns.

If you're wrestling with [specific problem], I'd love to compare notes.
```

## Personalization Checklist

Before sending ANY message:

**□ Recent Activity** - What did they post/share in last 7 days?
**□ Company News** - Funding, hiring, launch, expansion?
**□ Relationship Context** - When did you last talk? What about?
**□ Specific Value** - What EXACT problem can you solve for them?
**□ Voice Check** - Does this sound like you texting, not LinkedIn posting?
**□ No AI Patterns** - Remove "I hope this message finds you well," "I'd love to connect," etc.

---

## What NOT to Say

**Avoid:**

- "I came across your profile and was impressed"
- "Let me know if I can be of service"

- "Would you be open to a quick 15-min call?"

**Use instead:**
