## How to Use This with AI

This system is designed to work with AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.).

Once you fill in your context files, you can prompt your AI:

> "Read my linkedin-brain context and write a LinkedIn post about [topic] using the content frameworks."

> "Draft an outreach message for [contact name] using my voice and the message frameworks."

> "Help me plan a discovery call with [company] using the discovery call guide."

## Core Philosophy

### Content Creation
- **Handwritten > Templated:** Write like you're texting, not posting
- **Numbers > Adjectives:** "98% fail" not "Most fail" / "€50k wasted" not "A lot of money"
- **Experience > Theory:** Personal stories beat abstract principles
- **Direct > Hedged:** Commit to your POV, no hedging language
- **Industry-Agnostic:** Works for Product, Marketing, Sales, Finance, Design, HR, Operations, etc.

### Outreach
- **Value-First:** Lead with insights, not asks
- **Personalization:** Reference specific context
- **Follow-Up:** 60-70% conversions happen in touches 2-3
- **Long Game:** Some contacts convert after years
